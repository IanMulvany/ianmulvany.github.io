      <p>These are the slides from a keynote that I gave in May 2025 at Publisher Speak. </p>
      <p>Back in January I wrote a somewhat tongue in cheek blog post about things that might be true about scholarly publishing -- <a href="https://world.hey.com/ian.mulvany/what-things-might-be-true-about-scholarly-publishing-11d227f3">https://world.hey.com/ian.mulvany/what-things-might-be-true-about-scholarly-publishing-11d227f3</a>, and since then I've been looking to find some time to create a more constructive and positive overview of my thoughts. This talk was a great opportunity to do that. </p>
      <p>Having worked for about twenty years in the field I decided to take a slightly more reflective stance. I used Simon Willison's tool for annotating slides to put this post together - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/</a>. </p>
      <p>The topic of the talk is about the future. I don't think there is anything unique or novel in this talk, but I really wanted to get across my enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead of us. </p>
      <p>(As a side note, I used GenAI for a lot of the visuals in this presentation, for which I am absolutly unapologetic, it saved me a ton of time). </p>

      <h2>Introduction: Inspirations</h2>
      <p>Much of the thinking behind this talk is inspired by the following three sources. </p>

      <h2>The Knowledge Machine</h2>
      <p>I've seen The Knowledge Machine by Michael Strevens - <a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia/-">https://www.strevens.org/scientia/-</a>  described as a modern calssic in the making, and I fully agreee, it's the best book I've read on how science works, it has deeply informed by thinking and I go into the main arguments in this talk. </p>

      <h2>LLMs as Cultural Technologies</h2>
      <p>Large AI models are cultural and social technologies - <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt9819">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt9819</a> - by Farrell et. al. provides a good does of sanity aobut what LLMs are, or are not, and the framing here applies equally as well to science. </p>

      <h2>Trusted Identity</h2>
      <p>The two reports on Identity in publishing by STM are fantastic, clearly written and this work is important and vital to our industry - <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/new-stm-report-trusted-identity-in-academic-publishing/">https://stm-assoc.org/new-stm-report-trusted-identity-in-academic-publishing/</a>. </p>

      <h2>The Future Is Open</h2>
      <p>My first framing position is that the future is entirely open, entorely ahead of us, and we are in a consequential moment in the history of research. </p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways: Data, Identity, Trust</h2>
      <p>The main things I want people to take away from today are the following (if they have to pick just one thing to do, pick one of these).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strongly support data and code sharing as part of the scholarly record.  </li>
        <li>Take identity much more seriously than we have in the past.  </li>
        <li>Integrate with ORCID trust Markers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I think the need for supporting data, and the usefulness of ORCID, are well understood by our industry, so I'm going to be spending most of this talk focussing on identity as I think that's an area that needs a lot more attention. </p>

      <h2>Dryad: Supporting Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>But on data I want to give a shout out to <a href="https://datadryad.org">https://datadryad.org</a> which is a community run open infrastructure for publishing and curating research data. I've been on the board of Drayd for a number of years. Simply - authors can publish their data, and have it curated. It's a good example of a neutral piece of infrastructure that can support any field.</p>

      <h2>ORCID Trust Markers</h2>
      <p><a href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a> should be well know in our industry. ORCID have supported trust markers since 2021. These allow trusted institutions to add assertions onto the record of an individual. It's a way to do what it says on the tin - create a record of trusted assertions. We will come back to this idea later.  (<a href="https://world.hey.com/ian.mulvany/orcid-trust-markers-70e53877">https://world.hey.com/ian.mulvany/orcid-trust-markers-70e53877</a>)</p>

      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.013.jpeg" alt="What stays the same?">
      <h2>What Stays the Same?</h2>
      <p>I want to talk to day about what we do as an industry, and perhaps point a little to ways of thinking about what we should be doing in the future. </p>
      <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is often asked the question - what does he think will be different in the future, and his answer is that we shouldn't think so much about what will change, but more about what won't change. </p>
      <p>Those are the things that you can continue to build value around. In Amazon's case that was about increasing choice for customers, and driving prices down. </p>
      <p>I'm going to talk about what I think really matters in research, and what we have to do as an industry to support that. I think a lot of the <em>forms</em> of how we support research are up for grabs, and I think there is a lot of opportunity in how we design and deliver services, but I think in the long term the fundamentals will remain in place. </p>
      <p>Now of course there are things that are changing</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The locus of where political pressure is being exerted. </li>
        <li>The change in our experience of time that AI is giving us.</li>
        <li>Scale that is making some of the assumptions that we had been working under before untenable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But how do we get to a view of what those things are that might stay the same? </p>

      <h2>Strevens on Science</h2>
      <p>For an answer to that question I'm going to draw on this work. This is a specific and fairly opinionated view on how science works, building on top of the works of Popper and Khun. I acknowledge that you might not agree with evrything presented by Strevens, but I think it's really worth engaging with. </p>

      <h2>The Future We Make</h2>
      <p>We have had the process of rational enquiry, of natural philosophy, for only the blink of an eye. </p>
      <p>We have had web enabled science for even less time. </p>
      <p>And yet the future lies in front of us, as yet unmade. </p>
      <p>The decisions you make can shape that future. You have significant opportunity to build great things that will compound over time. </p>
