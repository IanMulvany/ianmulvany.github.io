    ">
      <p>These are the slides from a keynote that I gave in May 2025 at Publisher Speak. </p>
    <p>Back in January I wrote a somewhat tongue in cheek blog post about things that might be true about scholarly publishing -- <a href="https://world.hey.com/ian.mulvany/what-things-might-be-true-about-scholarly-publishing-11d227f3">https://world.hey.com/ian.mulvany/what-things-might-be-true-about-scholarly-publishing-11d227f3</a>, and since then I've been looking to find some time to create a more constructive and positive overview of my thoughts. This talk was a great opportunity to do that. </p>
    <p>Having worked for about twenty years in the field I decided to take a slightly more reflective stance. I used Simon Willison's tool for annotating slides to put this post together - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/</a>. </p>
    <p>The topic of the talk is about the future. I don't think there is anything unique or novel in this talk, but I really wanted to get across my enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead of us. </p>
    <p>(As a side note, I used GenAI for a lot of the visuals in this presentation, for which I am absolutly unapologetic, it saved me a ton of time). </p>

      <p>Much of the thinking behind this talk is inspired by the following three sources. </p>

      <p>The talk is quite long, so I wanted to get the key take away messages out at the very start. </p>

    <div class="slide">
      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.008.jpeg" alt="Image of a light cone. ">
      <p>My first framing position is that the future is entirely open, entorely ahead of us, and we are in a consequential moment in the history of research. </p>

    <div class="slide">
      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.010.jpeg" alt="data identity trust
    ">
      <p>The main things I want people to take away from today are the following (if they have to pick just one thing to do, pick one of these).</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Strongly support data and code sharing as part of the scholarly record.  </li>
    <li>Take identity much more seriously than we have in the past.  </li>
    <li>Integrate with ORCID trust Markers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think the need for supporting data, and the usefulness of ORCID, are well understood by our industry, so I'm going to be spending most of this talk focussing on identity as I think that's an area that needs a lot more attention. </p>

      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.013.jpeg" alt="What stays the same?">
      <p>I want to talk to day about what we do as an industry, and perhaps point a little to ways of thinking about what we should be doing in the future. </p>
    <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is often asked the question - what does he think will be different in the future, and his answer is that we shouldn't think so much about what will change, but more about what won't change. </p>
    <p>Those are the things that you can continue to build value around. In Amazon's case that was about increasing choice for customers, and driving prices down. </p>
    <p>I'm going to talk about what I think really matters in research, and what we have to do as an industry to support that. I think a lot of the _forms_ of how we support research are up for grabs, and I think there is a lot of opportunity in how we design and deliver services, but I think in the long term the fundamentals will remain in place. </p>
    <p>Now of course there are things that are changing</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The locus of where political pressure is being exerted. </li>
    <li>The change in our experience of time that AI is giving us.</li>
    <li>Scale that is making some of the assumptions that we had been working under before untenable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But how do we get to a view of what those things are that might stay the same? </p>

      <p>For an answer to that question I'm going to draw on this work. This is a specific and fairly opinionated view on how science works, building on top of the works of Popper and Khun. I acknowledge that you might not agree with evrything presented by Strevens, but I think it's really worth engaging with. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.016.jpeg" alt="® Iron Rule
    Baconian Convergence
    ">
      <p>At the heard of his thesis are two key ideas - the iron rule of evidence, and how evidence converges to an agreed view - what he calls Baconion Convergence. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.017.jpeg" alt="Sphere">
      <p>The mental model that I like is of all of human knowelge being something like a sphere. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.018.jpeg" alt="Zoomed in sphere">
      <p>I like to think that our knowledge of the world grows over time. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.019.jpeg" alt="Spiky surface">
      <p>But if we zoom right in to the surface of the sphere it's kind of spikey. These spikes are where researchers are pushing our boundaries of knowledge forward. If you are working at the tip of one field you might as well be almost disconnected from the tip of another field. </p>
    <p>The <strong>Iron Rule</strong> states that the only permissible move, when working at the cutting edge of science, is to tie your public claims about the world to observable evidence. This is the only thing that you are alloed to publish, you can't publish hypotheticals, or lay claims to other sources of validation for your claimes (e.g. beauty or harmony) </p>
    <p>While this sounds obvious because we are all used to the process of science today, Interestingly Strevens says that this is actually a deeply irrational and un-human like way to behave. </p>
    <p><strong>Baconian convergernce</strong> then happens when we have data that is initially unclear, but over time becomes resolves to one side of an argument, or another. </p>
    <p>There are some other interesting by-products of this structure. </p>
    <p>One of these is that it can make cross disciple work very difficult. The sub-norms that emerge in one particular field can make it hard to bring in calims from another field, and by the time calims become normalised as part of the common set of knowelge that we have, fields will have moved on. </p>
    <p>Another interesting aspect of this is that if you are at the tip of one of these fields you may well know all of the other key researchers working in your area. You may, in fact, believe that there might be no need for journals, or for peer review, as you are working wthiin a shared context of what is known and what is accepted. (I'll come back to this again later). </p>
    </div>

      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.020.jpeg" alt="e Competition
    
    o Accreditation
    
    o Difference between private and public narrative
    e The imperative to not mess with the system
    ">
      <p>So the Iron Rule, and Baconion convergence are the mechanisms that drive science forward, but there are supporting tacit norms that are needed too. </p>
    <p>A lot of the work to push the boundary of knowledge is hard, thankless. It takes a lot of sacrifice, so you need to have competitive people engaged in this. </p>
    <p>For that to work you need to have the right level of accreditation. There has to be some  form of reward in place. </p>
    <p>It's also important to recognise that this process is done by humans, with all of the failings and frailties that this brings. How folk behave in private, and the claims they make in informal spaces, can be, and will be, different from the publicly posted claims in the scientific record - according to this iron rule. </p>
    <p>Lastly Strevens says that an important key factor is to not change this system too much. It does not need to suffer from over optimisation. </p>

    ">
      <p>I think one of the more contestable points made in the book is that this system originated in the middle of 17th century. I acknowledge that this could be a point of debate, but I am persuaded (and that might be due to my own background as an astrophysicist). </p>
    <p>The claim here is that when Newton publishing results that stood purely on their observational power, and not grounded from any other type of rational argument, led to the birth of the Iron rule. </p>
    <p>This in turn laid the foundation for a modern science that has been remarkably effective. </p>

    <div class="slide">
      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.022.jpeg" alt="Timeline, from writing through to today. ">
      <p>To put that into context, the claim here is that we have only been doing modern science for a few hundred years. This is a blink of an eye in human history. </p>

      <p>It's also true that the world we are in, the facts of the world we are in, have no consideration for us. The facts of the world don't shape themselves for us, or for our convenience. That's why the Iron rule is so important. </p>

    A cultural and social technologies is a system or tool that enables
    humans to access, process, reorganise, transform, and restructure
    information accumulated by other humans, facilitating large-scale
    coordination within society
    ">
      <p>It's a socio technical system. Drawing from this paper - 		<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adt9819">https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adt9819</a> these are "systems or tools that enables humans to access, process, reorganise, transform, and restructure information accumulated by other humans, facilitating large-scale coordination within society"</p>
    <p>Large AI models are also cultural and social technologies. </p>
    <p>We rely on social institutions (markets, democracies, bureaucracies) to coordinate information/decision-making. These can be thought of as technologies.</p>
    <p>These systems often use lossy representations of the state of affairs, but they are useful representations (price mechanism, election results, GDP, bureaucratic categories)</p>
    <p>The publishing ecosystem operates on a level of abstraction a few steps away from the underlying reality and so the way we interact with the core content -- through the processes that we have created -- loses some details as you get more removed from the immediacy of the experiments. </p>
    <p>These systems tend to lead to the emergence of institutions (normative, regulatory, editors, peer review, libel laws, election law, etc.) to temper effects.</p>
    <p>Our institutions need to evolve as we have to operate with more scale.</p>
    <p>LLMs generate new possibilities for recombining information and coordinating actions at scale. </p>
    <p>Example socio technical systems:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pictures</li>
    <li>Writing</li>
    <li>Print</li>
    <li>Video</li>
    <li>Internet search</li>
    <li>Economic markets</li>
    <li>State bureaucracies</li>
    <li>Representative democracies</li>
    <li>Spoken language</li>
    <li>Libraries</li>
    <li>Newspapers</li>
    <li>Wikipedia</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example Institutions that emerged:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Editors  </li>
    <li>Peer review  		</li>
    <li>Libel laws  </li>
    <li>Election law  </li>

      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.029.jpeg" alt="Spiky surface">
      <p>So far I've talked about our current structure of science. It's one example of a socio-techncial system with the strong and somewhat unique characteristic of this iron rule. (It would be all too easy to imagine us losing this iron rule).</p>
    <p>There are a couple attributes of this system that I want to mention before moving on. </p>
    <p>We can kind of proxy the number of spikes on the surface of human knowledge with the number of journals that exist, about 35K at this point in time, five to seven million contributions at those endpoint per year, kind of. </p>
    <p>It is probably true that most science that is done is in the more normal range, filling in details, being a vehicle to support careers, not so much at the very sharp points of uncertainty. </p>
    <p>But we also don't know the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>We don't know ahead of time what area of basic research will result in a significant breakthrough for society. </li>
    <li>We don't know ahead of time how long it will take for any piece of basic research to have that societal impact. </li>
    <li>We can't tell ahead of time at what point in their carrer an academic will enter their "hot phase" where their work is really meaningful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And we do know:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The world is filled with complexity and detail, beyond our full ability to map it all.  </li>
    <li>If we overly concentrate lines of attack (funding too similar groups) we get worse results than if that funding is spread across more diverse bets.</li>
    </ul>

      <img src="PublisherSpeak Keynote - May 2025.030.jpeg" alt="AN INTRODUCTION TO CYBERNETICS - Ross Ashby
    ">
      <p>This is encapsualted really nicely by a law derived by Ross Ashby in 1956 - "Ashby's law of requisite variety"</p>

    <p>What his analysis found is that any system needs to have as many degrees of freedom as the environment it is operating in to be effective. </p>
    <p>That means when we are looking at complex systems we need to have a lot of complexity. We need lots of different viewpoints on our world in order to be able to understand out world effectively. </p>

      <p>I think it's an interesting challenge that we have as an industry. We all want to demonstrate impact, to create real value, and yet the timeline for the outcome of science to create that impact is uncertain, but almost certainly longer than and single funding round from a grant call, or any single initiative that we might invest in. </p>
    <p>And yet by our very nature we are compelled to try to make improvements. </p>

    of our knowledge is the most important thing. @ Open access,

    Making that work is the game, so to speak.
    We are now in:
    the research integrity era. 
    Many industry efforts, while not unimportant, are
    attempts to break past this fundamental truth.
    ">
      <p>I think a lot of the initiatives in our industry are attempts to break through that constraint. I think what we do is better as a result of these things, and in each case there have been periods of figuring things out. We can certainly get very caught up in these initiatives. </p>
    <p>The key one right now is research integrity. </p>

    ">
      <p>But I want us to always think about that slow steady improvement that is the result of research, and when thinking about it that way I think two things we should always be striving for are creating the highest quality scholarly record that we can, and reducing the pain and cost for individuals in participating in this activity (that could be actual cost, or cost in time, or cost in complexity). </p>

      <p>That timeline of science is so short, and we really only have had one generation, maybe two, doing web enabled science. The coming generation will be doing AI enabled science! </p>
    <p>And yet we are operating with some of the rules of science from the 17th century. Our scale of operation has increased, but we have not sufficiently updated the mechanisms of our institution to acommodate for that scale change. </p>

      <p>And I would say that as we think about the changes we must make we have to be careful about the decisions we make. Those decisions will have consequences that will echo into the future. </p>
    <p>Getting to the web early has been a huge success for scholarship. At the time XML seemed like a good idea, but now most people building infrastructure are trying to build away from that decision, and it's really hard. </p>
    <p>The APC seemed like a good reasonably transparent decision for creating a functioning business model around open access, but it has led to concerns about barriers to publishing, and to a large amount of complexity in how transactions are managed. </p>
    <p>And impact factor has been used a lot more than the creators of it thought it would. It has actively changed research behaviour by accidentally being the reward mechanism for research. </p>
